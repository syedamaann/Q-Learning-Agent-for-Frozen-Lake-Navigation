# Q-Learning Agent for Frozen Lake Navigation

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Q-Learning Agent for Frozen Lake Navigation project. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the implementation details, setup instructions, and execution of the Q-Learning algorithm in the context of the Frozen Lake environment provided by OpenAI Gym.

## Introduction to the Project

This project demonstrates the application of the Q-Learning algorithm, a form of reinforcement learning, to navigate through the Frozen Lake environment. The Frozen Lake is a grid-world where an agent must find the safest path from the start point (S) to the goal (G) without falling into any holes (H). This environment provides a perfect setup to understand the fundamentals of reinforcement learning and Q-Learning.

### Environment Details

The Frozen Lake environment consists of:

- **S (Start)**: The starting point for the agent.
- **F (Frozen)**: Safe spots where the agent can move.
- **H (Hole)**: Holes that the agent must avoid.
- **G (Goal)**: The destination point that the agent aims to reach.

Navigating this environment requires strategic movements that balance the exploration of new paths and the exploitation of known safe routes.

## Core Concept: Q-Learning

Q-Learning is an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that seeks to find the best action to take given the current state. It operates by estimating the values of the actions using the Q-function, which is iteratively updated based on the Bellman equation.

### The Q-Learning Formula

The Q-values are updated as follows:

```
Q(state, action) = (1 - α) * Q(state, action) + α * (reward + γ * max(Q(next state, all actions)))
```

Where:
- `α` (Alpha) is the learning rate, determining the extent to which new information overrides old information.
- `γ` (Gamma) is the discount factor, prioritizing immediate over distant future rewards.


## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps to set up your environment and execute the program.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or newer installed on your system. Python can be downloaded from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/syedamaann/Q-Learning-Agent-for-Frozen-Lake-Navigation.git
   cd Q-Learning-Agent-for-Frozen-Lake-Navigation
   ```

2. Install the necessary Python packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Program

To start the Q-Learning process, run the following command in the terminal:

```
python q_learning_frozenlake.py
```

## Detailed Explanation of the Program

The script `q_learning_frozenlake.py` initializes the Frozen Lake environment and sets up the Q-table that will be used to store and update the Q-values. The agent explores the environment, with its actions guided by the Q-table, and updates the Q-values based on the rewards received from each action.

### Understanding the Output

The program outputs the updated Q-table after a predefined number of episodes, showing the learned Q-values for each state-action pair. Additionally, it computes the average reward over time to gauge the agent's performance and learning progress.

### Visualization and Analysis

While the primary output is textual, the script can be modified to render the environment graphically, allowing you to visually track the agent's journey across the Frozen Lake. This aids in understanding how the agent learns to navigate the environment over time.
