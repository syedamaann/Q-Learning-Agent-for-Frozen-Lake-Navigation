# Q-Learning-Agent-for-Frozen-Lake-Navigation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm applied to the Frozen Lake environment from OpenAI Gym. Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that aims to learn the value of an action in a particular state. It uses a Q-table to guide the actions that the agent should take to maximize rewards.

## Environment

The Frozen Lake game is a grid world environment where the agent must navigate from a starting point to the goal without falling into holes. It's a simple yet challenging environment that tests the agent's ability to learn from interactions.

- **S**: start
- **F**: frozen surface (safe)
- **H**: hole (fall and fail)
- **G**: goal

## Algorithm: Q-Learning

Q-Learning works by updating a table of Q-values (rewards) for each action in each state. It follows the equation:

```
Q(state, action) = Q(state, action) + α * (reward + γ * max(Q(next state, all actions)) - Q(state, action))
```

where:
- `α` (alpha) is the learning rate.
- `γ` (gamma) is the discount factor.

## Project Structure

- `q_learning_frozenlake.py`: The main Python script containing the Q-Learning implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the project dependencies for pip.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/q-learning-frozen-lake.git
   cd q-learning-frozen-lake
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Program

Execute the script with the following command:

```
python q_learning_frozenlake.py
```

## How It Works

The program initializes the Frozen Lake environment and the Q-table. The agent explores the environment by choosing actions based on the current Q-values, updating the Q-table based on the rewards received. Over time, the agent learns to navigate the lake more effectively.

## Visualization

The script can be modified to render the environment's graphical representation, showing the agent's movement through the grid. This feature is turned off by default to speed up the training process.
